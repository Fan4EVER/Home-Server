main.py will host the server

index.html acts as the home/landing page

cloud.html will serve as a storage space

movies.html will serve as my own personal "Netflix"

style.css will add styling to all 3 html files

func.js will add javascript to all 3 html files

Working:
    main.py HTTP hosting
    index.html
    style.css (all though not much has been done here yet)

Not Working:
    getting the directory for the movies page

I need to figure out how to get a list of all files in the directory, get that list into movies.html (this is my main problem), use those file names to make a list in movies.html
